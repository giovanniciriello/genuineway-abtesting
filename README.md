# Genuine Way 

Postgraduate project in ICT Engineering, Business and Innovation at Politecnico di Milano in Leadership & Innovation. The project includes an angular application that, through the ab testing technique aims to collect user data and choose which interface performs best.

In the public code there is no part of how the data is collected and the project is intended purely for academic purposes.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
